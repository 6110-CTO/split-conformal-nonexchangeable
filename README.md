# Split Conformal Prediction for Non-Exchangeable Data

This repository contains the code for the paper "Split Conformal Prediction for Non-Exchangeable Data" (Roberto I. Oliveira, Paulo Orenstein, Thiago Ramos, Jo√£o Vitor Romano).

## Setup

- All scripts should be run from the git repository root directory (`split-conformal-nonexchangeable/`).
- Packages listed in `requirements.txt` should be installed via your python package manager of choice.
- Python 3.10+ is required.

## Structure

- **src**: project source code (pushed to the repository).
- **data**: raw and processed datasets.
- **eval**: plots, tables and other output used to evaluate coverage.

## Generate figures and table

### Figures 1 and 2

- Run `sh src/paper/synthetic-marginal_coverage.sh` to generate the results.
- Run `python src/eval/synthetic/plot-marginal_coverage.py --stochastic_process ar1` to plot.
- Run `python src/eval/synthetic/plot-marginal_coverage.py --stochastic_process two_state_markov_chain` to plot.

### Figure 3a

- Run `sh src/paper/theoretical_guarantee.sh` to generate the results.
- Run `python src/eval/synthetic/plot-theoretical_guarantee.py` to plot.

### Figure 3b

- Run `sh src/paper/synthetic-empirical_coverage.sh` to generate the results.
- Run `python src/eval/synthetic/plot-empirical_coverage.py` to plot.

### Download and process financial data

- Run `python src/data/download.py` to download the data.
- Run `sh src/paper/real_datasets-process.sh` to generate the datasets.

### Figure 4

- Run `python src/eval/real/marginal_coverage.py --dataset eurusd` to generate the results.
- Run `python src/eval/real/marginal_coverage.py --dataset bcousd` to generate the results.
- Run `python src/eval/real/marginal_coverage.py --dataset spxusd` to generate the results.
- Run `python src/eval/real/plot-marginal_coverage.py` to plot.

### Table 1

- Run `sh src/paper/real-conditional_coverage.sh` to generate the results.
- Run `python src/eval/real/table-conditional_coverage.py` to create the table.
